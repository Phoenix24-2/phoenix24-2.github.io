Tried a simple React app here.

It's using React Router alongside TypeScript and Vite.

-React
-React Router
-TypeScript
-UI Design
-Form submission using React Router (Action + Loader props)

note: this was a challenge.

#TODO:
1- Can't figure out a way to pass user's email form input from SignupPage to SuccessPage without it being shown in the url (which obvs is not a safe approach!! ) 
2- Could add a database later, too.
